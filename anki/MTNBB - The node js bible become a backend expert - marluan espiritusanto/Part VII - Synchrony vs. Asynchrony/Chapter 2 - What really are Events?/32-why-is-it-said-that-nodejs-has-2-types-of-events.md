Q: Why is it said that nodejs has 2 types of events?  
A: They are often connected to each other, but **node** on the one hand **handles the system events (C++, the nodejs core) thanks to the livuv library**.  
On the other hand there are the **custom events that are triggered by the event handler inside the javascript core**.
