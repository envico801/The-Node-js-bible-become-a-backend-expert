Q: What are the disadvantages of monolithic applications?  
A: 1.They are not flexible e.g. (if we start with a programming language we have to finish with that one because we will not be able to change it).  
2.Difficult to maintain e.g. (the demand can make the application unsustainable).  
3.Difficult to scale e.g. (if you want to scale horizontally you have to duplicate the whole application instead of just 1 single component)  
4.Unreliable potential e.g. (if something is damaged inside the application, the whole application will be damaged).
