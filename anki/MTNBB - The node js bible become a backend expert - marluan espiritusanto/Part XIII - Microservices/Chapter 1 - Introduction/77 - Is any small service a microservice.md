Q: Is any small service a microservice?  
A: No, microservices have the following characteristics:  
1.Single responsibility.  
2.They are persistent e.g. (data cannot be breached, lost, etc.).  
3.They are resilient e.g. (if a microservice crashes, it must know how to get up and know where it left off).  
4.They have logs e.g. (we should know at all times in what state and what our microservice has done, even what it is doing at the moment).  
5.They have a well defined API e.g. (I have to know if I am going to communicate with it with REST, rabbid enqueue, message broker, etc).
