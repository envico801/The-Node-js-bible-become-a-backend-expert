Q: What are the advantages of microservices?  
A: 1.Super easy to scale e.g. (if we have a service that is being consumed more than the others we only have to scale that one and not the whole application).  
2.Combination of technologies e.g. (we can take advantage of the different benefits of several programming languages).  
3.Reliable potential e.g. (we know the state in which each of the microservices is and we know that if any of them fails it must be able to get up again).  
4.Transparent Deploys e.g. (we can count on a CI/CD that will help us to bring a service to production with a simple commit).
