Q:: What is ECMA?  
A:: It is an organization for information and communication systems.

Q:: What is ECMAScript?  
A:: It is the "rules" that govern the current javascript language. It was created because in the past browser manufacturers began to create their own interpretations of the language and with them came small adjustments and differences.

```

Q:: What are the javascript collections?  
A:: Array, Set, Map

#### Chapter 3 - Value Types in JavaScript

#### Chapter 4 - Variables

Q:: What is a variable?  
A:: It is a space in memory that is created to store data and a name is used to access this space. You can imagine it as the key to a door.

#### Chapter 5 - Logical operators

Q:: What is a logical operator (what does it allow us to do)?  
A:: It allows us to combine several expressions and from them produce a boolean value.

#### Chapter 6 - Conditionals

#### Chapter 9 - Loops

#### Chapter 10 - Functions

#### Chapter 11 - Theory: Callbacks

Q:: What is a callback?  
A:: It is a function that is passed as an argument to another function to execute it. Usually the function that is passed as an argument is a pointer/address in memory.

Q:: What is the first parameter in a callback function?  
A:: The first parameter should correspond to an error (if any).

#### Chapter 14 - Theory: Promises

#### Chapter 15 - Practice: Promises

#### Chapter 16 - Theory: Async/Await

A:: This will cause the function to return a promise. And it also allows us to use the "await" word to handle other promises within the function.

Q:: What happens when the await word is called?  
A:: Calling the await word causes code execution to pause until a promise is resolved or rejected. It will return a completed promise

### Part VI - Modules, Exports & require

#### Chapter 1 - What the heck is a module?

Q:: What is a module?  
A:: It is a reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally affect other code.

Q:: What is CommonJS?  
A:: It is a set of rules for how code modules should be structured. Its format has been heavily influenced by NodeJS module management.

#### Chapter 2 - Creating Our First Module

Q:: Why does node create a module cache?  
A:: Because by requiring a module node will "cache" the content of the module using a singleton (a single instance) that will be stored in memory during the execution of the code.

Q:: Why do you have to export components of a module?  
A:: Because everything that is not plain code will require you to export it explicitly, for example:

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  return "Hi!";
}
module.export = myFunction;
// ---
const importedFun = require("./myModule");
importedFun(); // "Hi!"
```

Q:: In what order node looks for the available modules?  
A:: It looks for them first in the main directory and if it doesn't find them there it will look for them in "./node_modules", if it doesn't find them there it will produce an error.

### Part VII - Synchrony vs. Asynchrony

#### Chapter 1 - Introduction

Q:: What is asynchrony?  
A:: It is more than one process/thing running simultaneously.

Q:: Does Node do things asynchronously?  
A:: Yes, but its engine (v8) does them synchronously.

Q:: What is synchrony?  
A:: One process or one thing running at a time.

Q:: Why is javascript said to be synchronous?  
A:: Because it executes line by line, it was designed for that, there is always only 1 thing running at any given time.

#### Chapter 2 - What really are Events?

Q:: What is an event?  
A:: It is a situation that has happened in our application, to which we can respond. This concept is found in many areas of software architecture.

Q:: Why is it said that nodejs has 2 types of events?  
A:: They are often connected to each other, but **node** on the one hand **handles the system events (C++, the nodejs core) thanks to the livuv library**.  
On the other hand there are the **custom events that are triggered by the event handler inside the javascript core**.

Q:: What kind of events does livuv send?  
A:: Livuv sends events that are occurring within the computer system (at a low level).

Q:: Why is it said that the 2 types of events that exist in node are connected?  
A:: Because many times the events that are executed at system level (with the livuv library) are forwarded to the javascript event handler, that's why many times they are confused with only 1 thing.

Q:: Why is it said that there are no "real" events in javascript?  
A:: Javascript does not have the concept of "event" (there is no event type), in reality what is happening is a "trick" (it is a simulation, it is just an object with properties).

Q:: Why is the term "syntactic-sugar" used when talking about classes?  
A:: Because it is used to simulate the behavior of first-order functions.

#### Chapter 3 - Creating Our Own Event Emitter

#### Chapter 4 - Event Emitter

Q:: What are magic strings?  
A:: A magic string is a string that declares directly in several places in a code without assigning it to a variable.  
According to magic strings, a programâ€™s behavior can change.  
Examples of magic strings include cache keys, specific URL patterns, prefixes, user types.

```javascript
function myFun(foo) {
  if (foo == "bar") {
    // do something
  }
}
// and someone accidentally types:
myFun("barr");
```

#### Chapter 5 - Libuv, Event Loop and Non-Blocking IO?

Q:: Is the event loop concept part of the javascript engine (V8) or of the livuv library?  
A:: The event loop is part of the livuv library, it is something that is usually implemented by each javascript runtime environment to handle asynchronism, for example, the browser also implements its own version without using the livuv library.

Q:: What is the event loop?  
A:: We could say that **it is a connector between worlds**, on the one hand **the event queue** (that have environments like node or chrome, etc) **and** on the other hand **the callstack** (by the javascript engine V8), **it is used to handle asynchronous events because javascript is synchronous**, first priority is given to the actions that are in the callback and then once it is emptied will begin to run the events in the queue.

Q:: What is non-blocking IO?  
A:: It is the ability to do actions without pausing or stopping other actions (as long as it is done correctly).

### Part VIII - HTTP Protocol and Web Servers

#### Chapter 1 - Introduction

Q:: What is HTTP?  
A:: It is the system that allows the transfer of information between different services and the clients that use web pages (or any application that invokes the HTTP protocol).

Q:: What is a web server?  
A:: It is the software that is responsible for delivering the content of a website to the user.

A:: To read a resource

Q:: For what purpose is the POST (HTTP) verb used?  
A:: To create a new resource

Q:: For what purpose is the PUT (HTTP) verb used?  
A:: To replace an existing resource

Q:: For what purpose is the PATCH (HTTP) verb used?  
A:: To update a property of a resource (often used interchangeably with the PUT verb, but PUT is used when you want to update a resource completely).

Q:: For what purpose is the DELETE verb (HTTP) used?  
A:: To remove a resource

Q:: What is middleware?  
A:: It is a block of code that runs between the request made by the user until the request reaches the server, it is an intermediary.

Q:: What is the MVC pattern?  
A:: Software design pattern for programming that proposes to separate the code of the programs by their different responsibilities.

#### Chapter 10 - Quotes Project: Part III

### Part IX - Databases

#### Chapter 1 - Introduction

Q:: From what year did SQL (relational) databases start to be used?  
A:: They started to be used in the 80's and until today they are still the most popular option.

Q:: What is a relational database?  
A:: The principle of relational databases is based on the organization of information in small pieces, which are related to each other through the relationship of identifiers.  
This allows to make relationships with other tables (which is the representation of the entity in the database).

Q:: What is ACID?  
A:: It means **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, **Isolation** and **Durability**.

Q:: What properties do relational databases bring to systems?  
A:: They bring properties that allow them to be more robust and less vulnerable to failures.

Q:: What is a NO-SQL (non-relational) database?  
A:: As its name suggests, non-relational databases are those that, unlike relational databases, do not have an identifier that serves as a relationship between one set of data and another. They are very useful when we do not have an exact schema of what is going to be stored.

Q:: What is an ORM?  
A:: **Object Relational Mapping**, is a programming model that consists of the transformation of the tables of a database, in a series of entities (a model, class or a simple object) that simplify the basic tasks of access to the data for the programmer.

Q:: What is an ODM?  
A:: It is the same as an ORM but it is intended for non-relational databases (NO-SQL).

### Part XIII - Microservices

#### Chapter 1 - Introduction

Q:: What is monolithic architecture?  
A:: It is a single logical executable, a single autonomous unit, an example is the MVC pattern, where everything we need is in the same place.

Q:: What is vertical scaling?  
A:: Vertical scaling refers to scaling by adding more power (e.g. CPU, RAM) to an existing machine (also described as "scaling up").

Q:: What is horizontal scaling?  
A:: Horizontal scaling means scaling by adding more machines to your pool of resources (also described as "scaling out"). We would have to set up a load balancer, make sure that if one of our services stops working the others will pick up the slack, etc.

Q:: What is the recommended approach when starting to build an application?  
A:: It is recommended to start with a monolith and then as the demand increases you convert it into microservices.

Q:: What are the advantages of monolithic applications?  
A:: 1.Simple to develop  
2.Simple to test  
3.Easy to work alone  
4.Simple to deploy

Q:: What are the disadvantages of monolithic applications?  
A:: 1.They are not flexible e.g. (if we start with a programming language we have to finish with that one because we will not be able to change it).  
2.Difficult to maintain e.g. (the demand can make the application unsustainable).  
3.Difficult to scale e.g. (if you want to scale horizontally you have to duplicate the whole application instead of just 1 single component)  
4.Unreliable potential e.g. (if something is damaged inside the application, the whole application will be damaged).

Q:: What is microservices architecture?  
A:: It is a collection of small, autonomous services with unique responsibilities.

Q:: Is any small service a microservice?  
A:: No, microservices have the following characteristics:  
1.Single responsibility.  
2.They are persistent e.g. (data cannot be breached, lost, etc.).  
3.They are resilient e.g. (if a microservice crashes, it must know how to get up and know where it left off).  
4.They have logs e.g. (we should know at all times in what state and what our microservice has done, even what it is doing at the moment).  
5.They have a well defined API e.g. (I have to know if I am going to communicate with it with REST, rabbid enqueue, message broker, etc).

Q:: What are the advantages of microservices?  
A:: 1.Super easy to scale e.g. (if we have a service that is being consumed more than the others we only have to scale that one and not the whole application).  
2.Combination of technologies e.g. (we can take advantage of the different benefits of several programming languages).  
3.Reliable potential e.g. (we know the state in which each of the microservices is and we know that if any of them fails it must be able to get up again).  
4.Transparent Deploys e.g. (we can count on a CI/CD that will help us to bring a service to production with a simple commit).

Q:: What are the disadvantages of microservices?  
A:: 1.Difficult to test (together) e.g. (if we have 1000 microservices we have to do an independent deployment of each one of them and also test them globally all together).  
2.Possibility of duplication e.g. (it can happen that there are so many microservices that microservices with the same functionality are created).  
3.Information integrity e.g. (ideally each microservice would have to have a totally different database, but then it may be the case that in one of these databases there is duplicity and not in another. In these cases it is necessary to know that the architecture must be respected so that the integrity of the information/data is maintained).  
4.Specialized teams e.g. (developers are expected to have DevOps experience, they have to deliver the application, localized, tested, etc).

Q:: What is Kubernetes?  
A:: It is a container orchestrator that takes care of the maintenance of our applications.

Q:: What is an API gateway?  
A:: It is an entity that is in charge of receiving the requests and then it is going to pass it to the microservice responsible for responding.

### Part XIV - CI/CD

#### Chapter 1 - Introduction

Q:: What is continuous integration?  
A:: It is a process where every change we make to our code must be tested and verified by the tests we have written beforehand.

Q:: What is continuous delivery?  
A:: It is similar to continuous integration, only in a more automated way and also our acceptance tests must be of high quality, because Continuous Delivery makes sure that every change we make is ready to be released to production.

Q:: What is continuous deployment?  
A:: As the name implies, we take care of continuous and automated deployments.

Q:: What is a pipeline?  
A:: It is a sequence of steps to be followed in a DevOps process.
